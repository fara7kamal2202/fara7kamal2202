## 👋 Hello there!

My name is Farah, and I’m an aspiring 💻 programmer, 📸 photographer, 🏃🏽‍♀️ runner, and ✈️ traveler. My interest in AI has been constantly growing, so this space is where I apply the concepts I learn and build fun programming projects along the way.

📚📚 I absolutely love reading, and some of my favorite AI-related books so far are:

1. **_The Coming Wave_ by Mustafa Suleyman** — Written by the CEO of Microsoft AI, this book discusses the importance of regulating powerful technologies like AI to navigate the risks ahead.  
2. **_AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order_ by Kai-Fu Lee** — A deep dive into the global AI race and its social and economic impacts, especially on developing countries.  
3. **_KI Regulatorik – leicht gemacht_** — A super easy read that explains the EU AI Act and other international regulations, while also introducing important terminology in the field.  
4. **_Empire of AI_ by Karen Hao** — Written by an AI expert and investigative journalist, this book explores the AI boom, the companies leading it, and the environmental and ethical implications of the industry.

I’m always on the lookout for new book and podcast recommendations—especially about AI and tech, so feel free to reach out ☺️
